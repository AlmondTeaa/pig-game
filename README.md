# Pig Game

A simple dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of a web development learning course.

## Ì≥ù About

This project is based on Jonas Schmedtmann's Pig Game tutorial from his JavaScript course. I've made several modifications and enhancements to the original code to practice and demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript concepts.

## ÌæÆ How to Play

**Objective:** Be the first player to reach 100 points.

**Rules:**
1. Players take turns rolling a dice.
2. Each turn, a player can roll the dice multiple times to accumulate points in their "current" score.
3. If a player rolls a 1, their current score is lost and the turn passes to the other player.
4. Players can choose to "hold" their current score at any time, adding it to their total score and passing the turn.
5. The first player to reach 100 total points wins!
